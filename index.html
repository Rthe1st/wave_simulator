    <h2>Glossary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>${timeScale}$: What speed to play the simulation at, in microseconds per second of real time. So a value of
            100 means it's slowed down to one-thousandth of realtime - 10 means one hundred-thousandth, 1 means
            one-millionth.</li>
        <li>$t$: Time in microseconds since the source of sound started vibrating.</li>
        <li>$A$: Amplitude, this is the maximum displacement of the vibrating particles from their starting positions,
            or the peak magnitude of their oscillation<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn12"
                    id="r12">[12]</a></sup>. In millimeters.
            Amplitude can also refer to the change in pressure caused by a sound wave, in which case it's measure in
            pascals, not meters<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11">[11]</a></sup>. A sound wave's pressure amplitude is
            correlated with and caused by the amplitude of the sound particles' displacements.</li>
        <li>$v$: The speed of sound, or how fast vibrations propagate between sound particles/through the medium
            (air)<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7">[7]</a></sup>. In our simplified simulation properties of the medium like
            density affect it but it's independent of properties of the sound wave/particle vibrations (amplitude,
            frequency, etc).</li>
        <li>$f$: Frequency measured in hz.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8">[8]</a></sup>. At a particle level this is how
            many times the
            particle oscillates per
            second. At a sound wave level it's how many complete wave cycles pass through a given point per second.
            Both have the same value, with the sound wave's frequency being an emergent property of the sound particles'
            frequencies.</li>
        <li>$\lambda$: Wave length - the distance over which the wave's shape repeats<sup><a href="#fn5"
                    id="r5">[5]</a></sup>. You can see this in the simulation as the distance
            between peaks/troughs of pressure.</li>
        <li>$k$: The spatial angular frequency of the wave, describing how many wave cycles it completes per meter.
            Measured in radians per meter ($2\pi$ radians being one wave cycle).</li>
        <li>$x$: The initial distance of a particle from the sound source. It's displacement while vibrating is relative
            to this point. Together with $v$ it determines the phase offset of a particle's vibration relative to the
            sound source.</li>
        <li>$w$:The (temporal) angular frequency of the wave, describing how many oscillations it completes per second.
            Measured in
            radians per second ($2\pi$ radians being one wave cycle).</li>
        <li>$F$: A function representing how a particle's displacement changes over the course of one oscillation, which
            contributes to a sound's timbre<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11">[14]</a></sup>. It
            takes an
            angle in radians representing where in the current wave cycle the particle is (between $0$ and $2\pi$), and
            maps that
            to a displacement. The output is between -1 and 1 so you multiply by $A$ to find the distance in meters.
        </li>
        <li>$p$ the pressure caused by the sound wave, in pascals (pa)<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11">[11]</a></sup>. Our
            values are absolute, not relative to ambient air pressure. It's value is constantly changing at each point
            as the sound wave moves forward, which is why we use the Root Mean Square of it's value to get an average
            (see SPL). Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Examples_of_sound_pressure">a
                good list</a> of the pressures caused by different sounds.</li>
        <li>$Z_0$ is the characteristic acoustic impedance of the medium (air) the sound/vibration is in<sup><a
                    href="#fn9" id="r9">[9]</a></sup>. Kind of the resistance of the medium to the vibration.</li>
        <li>$\rho$ density of the medium (air) the vibration is in<sup><a href="#fn10" id="r10">[10]</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>$p_0$: reference pressure, approximately the quietest sound a young human with undamaged hearing can detect
            at 1,000 Hz<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">[3]</a></sup></li>
        <li>${RMS factor}$, each wave form has a different Root Mean Square factor that you can multiply by the wave's max pressure to find the RMS of the wave. For common wave forms there are formulae to calculate the RMS from the pressure directly<sup><a href="#fn4"
            id="r4">[4]</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>${SPL}$: The RMS pressure level caused by the sound, or (roughly) how loud it is.<sup><a href="#fn4"
                    id="r4">[4]</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        This model shows how characteristics of a sound wave emerge from the underlying movement of sound particles.
        Sound particles are the dots in the simulation <sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup>. You can think of a
        sound particle as representing the average movement of a large number of air molecules<sup><a href="#fn1"
                id="r1">[1]</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sound waves are caused by a source object vibrating - moving back and forth in a consistent pattern. As it
        vibrates, it moves the sound particles around it and they end up vibrating back and forth in the same pattern as
        the source. These sound particles then move the sound particles in front of them and so on, causing the
        vibration of the source to propagate through the air. Eventually the vibration propagates all the way to your
        eardrum - whose vibration is interpreted by your brain as sound.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the simulation above, imagine the moving line on the left as the source of the sound, and the listener being
        somewhere off to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
        However this propagation takes time - obviously the particles near the source are made to vibrate earlier. This
        causes the vibrations of the particles to be out of phase with each other, having all started at different
        times. The time it takes for vibrations to propagate among particles is determined by the underlying
        medium and this is what we call the speed of
        sound.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fact that the particles are vibrating out of phase is what causes the areas of low and high density
        particles to appear, as particles at a slow points in their cycle are caught up by those at a fast points, or
        vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
        The maximum increase or decrease in density of particles (measured as pressure) is determined by the
        distance each particles moves while vibrating and is called it's amplitude. This is a big factor in how loud
        we perceive it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        How often a particle vibrates per second is its frequency, and also gives the emergent sound wave its frequency.
    </p>
    <p>
        How a particle's displacement changes over the course of a vibration is what dictates a sound wave's shape, the
        timbre of the sound.
    </p>
    <h2>Limitations of the model</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Our imaginary sound wave doesn't lose energy (get quieter) as it progresses forwards.</li>
        <li>Everything is 2 dimensional.</li>
        <li>We don't model the propagation of a change in the sound source. When a setting is changed, we draw the model
            as if the new wave has already had time to propagate all the way
            from the left to the right of the simulation. In reality, if the vibrations on the right of the graph
            changed (it's displacement or frequency), it would take time for the new wave to propagate forwards - it
            would look like the new wave was chasing the old wave left to right.</li>
        <li>It doesn't let you can't model low frequency or quite sounds. This is because for most sounds in our hearing range the
            particle displacement is so small relative to the wavelength of the sound that you cannot usefully draw both
            on the same graph. For example, even a 100dB sound only causes a displacement of 100nm, which is tiny
            compared to the 172mm wave length of a ~2000hz sound. For lower frequencies the wave lengths are even bigger and so the problem is worse.</li>
        <li>At high frequencies you get thick bands of particles are the peak pressure points, and they get wider as
            frequency increase. I don't understand this and wether it's a bug, limitation our model, or a real effect.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things that felt important when I learnt them</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A sound wave causes no net movement of particles - that's what fans do, not speakers.</li>
        <li>To repeat what's above: frequency of a sound is how many times its particles are moving back and forth per
            second, it's amplitude is how far they are moving and it's timbre is what the graph of that movement over
            time
            looks like.</li>
        <li>Even the loudest noises we can hear involve pretty tiny displacements of air - that's why speaker cones
            don't need to move very far to make a loud noise. Maximum movement only needs to be in millimeters.</li>
        <li>Lower frequency sounds particles need to oscillate with a bigger amplitude to produce the same level of pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Footnotes</h2>
    <p id="fn1"><a href="#r1">[1]</a>You could in principle simulate molecules of air directly and see the same emergent
        effects - but you have to simulate a lot of them. Our simulation space represents a 100mm by 20mm area. Assume a
        depth of 10mm - 100mmx20mmx10mm volume of air contains 5.06e+20 molecules (<a
            href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-air-molecules-are-present-in-a-cubic-meter-of-air">based on 10e25
            molecules per meter cube</a>). The simulation can barely handle 20,000. You'd also have to simulate the
        physics of them colliding with each other. Their individual paths would be messy, but on average they would move
        like our sound particles do and you'd see the same sound waves emerge. You also wouldn't be able to draw the
        individual molecules anyway - at the scale needed to see the sound wave individual molecules would be smaller
        then a pixel.</p>
