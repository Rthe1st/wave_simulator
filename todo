* So dB level on right hand side of top pressure chart
* Improve the interactive equations
  *  Make a separate graph just to explain the single particle being modeled by them
  * This should focus on showing the movement of the single particle being modeled in the equations, and the impact of the various parameters
  * make equation x range same as the width of the simulation
  * make equation t range same as wave period (so you can see values for one whole wave cycle)
* Play the sounds being simulated (but with the volume scaled down - no 200dB sin waves please)
