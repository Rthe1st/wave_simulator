todo:
label everything
add unit ranges for simwidth and max displacement (and time)
    micro, nano, milli, etc
    as a hack for exponetial ranges
add a time slides for displacement of particle equation
    also update that equation when input values change
label the max displacement bars
more presets
better axis labels (include units on the ticks?)
fix animation timings
    use requestanimation frames timestamp to work out animation progress
    atm animation speed can look faster for a low timescale then a high one
    hopefully this fixes that
