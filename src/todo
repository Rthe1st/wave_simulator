code clean up

fix loudness quation display to show RMS being calculated

make the axis ranges for pressure/displacments graphs set size (max and min of sim domainm)
    but also make them exponential
consider removing units from equations
write up html sections
make equation x range same as sim width
make equation t range same as wave period (so you can see values for 1 whole wave cycle)
