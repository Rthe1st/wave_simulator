todo:
make the axis ranges for pressure/displacments graphs set size (max and min of sim domainm)
    but also make them exponential
consider dashed lines to link particles in sim to their particle in top/bottom graphs
consider removing units from equations
write up html sections
make equation x range same as sim width
make equation t range same as wave period (so you can see values for 1 whole wave cycle)
condier showing where the equations X would be in the sim
    cosnider ability to set sim time to equation time (with sim paused)
    or making a 'one particle' diagram just for the equation
add pause sim button
fix defalt (nt koadingf preset)
label wave lenght on sim (arrow between 2 points, dones;t need to be animated)
stretch: play the sounds
