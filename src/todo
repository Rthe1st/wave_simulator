todo:
label everything
add unit ranges for simwidth and max displacement (and time)
    micro, nano, milli, etc
    as a hack for exponetial ranges
add a time slides for displacement of particle equation
    also update that equation when input values change
label the max displacement bars
more presets
better axis labels (include units on the ticks?)
warn when animation speed to fast for particles
    leading to misleading animation
allow better time range scaling
try work out how to show (or at least explain why not) quite noises at low freq
at som epresets that just show waves property relationships nicely
    even if they arnt close to real worl noises
generay document what ranges diagrams work well in

stretch: play the sounds
