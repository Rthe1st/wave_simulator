todo:
label source and listener on diagram
display the drived values being used in the simualtion
    (wave lenght, k, etc)
label the pressure/displacement graphs better
    make then optional
Add moving 'speaker' cone to left of map
    add some kind of UI limit do stop the cone being moves off the left of the map
pressure graphdisplacement graphs have updside down scales and 

to make it clear that each dot is tracking one particles
    use highlighting on mouse over to make better
hide particles within 2*maxdisplacement of cone to prevent overlap

stetch: simulate propogation of changes in sounds from source to listener
    instead of it being instanious

    To do this:
        every time an input changes, save copy of state + timestamp
        for each state, use speed * timestamp - nextModelTimestamp
            to calcualte the max/min X of the canvas effected by these model settings
        then sort particles by X, and apply the correct model for the X value
    complication:
        if speed is changes, new state waves can catch passed waves
        to handle: workout where the is overlap
            in those areas, make displacement the sum of displacements from all overlapping states
